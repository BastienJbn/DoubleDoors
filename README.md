**Automatically open or close both doors with a single click!**

DoubleDoors is a lightweight **Fabric client mod for Minecraft 1.21.x** that makes handling double doors effortless. Simply click one door with an empty hand, and both doors will open or close simultaneously — no more awkwardly clicking each door individually. Sneak to override and open a single door, or hold a placeable item while sneaking to place blocks as usual.

## Usage

⚠️ Warning for Public Servers

This mod sends an additional interaction packet from the client to open the second door.
It is safe for normal servers, but some public servers with strict anti-cheat or packet validation may block or flag the extra interaction, which can cause the second door not to open or lead to temporary desync.
Use at your own discretion on heavily-modded or competitive servers.
