**Automatically open or close both doors with a single click!**

DoubleDoors is a lightweight **Fabric client mod for Minecraft 1.21.x** that makes handling double doors effortless. Simply click one door with an empty hand, and both doors will open or close simultaneously — no more awkwardly clicking each door individually. Sneak to override and open a single door, or hold a placeable item while sneaking to place blocks as usual.
